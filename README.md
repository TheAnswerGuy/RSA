Java Reverse Eng. - RSA public key enc. example

This is the RSA algorithm implementation for java, basically i took the idea from wikipedia then i written it on code
to use it with communication encryption systems that i made and i hope people could find this useful and interesting like me
when i decide to study it.

Generate the keys with KeyGenerator class that's return a KeyPair object with two Key 
objects at the same time, use them both to encrypt and decrypt messages on the internet 
or close networks to secure the confidence and integrity of the information that you have

Thanks for reading.
